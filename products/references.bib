A given disparity-related factor may affect outcomes differently at each point along the highly variable trajectory of the disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Objective{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}To examine clinical outcomes by race and ethnicity in patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) within the US Veterans Health Administration.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Design, Setting, and Participants{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}A retrospective, observational cohort study using electronic health care records (January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2021) in a nationwide equal-access health care system was conducted. Mean (SD) follow-up time was 4.3 (3.3) years. Patients included in the analysis were diagnosed with prostate cancer from January 1, 2006, to December 30, 2020, that progressed to nmCRPC defined by (1) increasing prostate-specific antigen levels, (2) ongoing androgen deprivation, and (3) no evidence of metastatic disease. Patients with metastatic disease or death within the landmark period (3 months after the first nmCRPC evidence) were excluded.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Main Outcomes and Measures{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The primary outcome was time from the landmark period to death or metastasis; the secondary outcome was overall survival. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, Kaplan-Meier estimates, and adjusted survival curves were used to evaluate outcome differences by race and ethnicity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Of 12 992 patients in the cohort, 826 patients identified as Hispanic (6\%), 3671 as non-Hispanic Black (28\%; henceforth Black), 7323 as non-Hispanic White (56\%; henceforth White), and 1172 of other race and ethnicity (9\%; henceforth other, including American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, unknown by patient, and patient declined to answer). Median time elapsed from nmCRPC to metastasis or death was 5.96 (95\% CI, 5.58-6.34) years for Black patients, 5.62 (95\% CI, 5.11-6.67) years for Hispanic patients, 4.11 (95\% CI, 3.96–4.25) years for White patients, and 3.59 (95\% CI, 3.23-3.97) years for other patients. Median unadjusted overall survival was 6.26 (95\% CI, 6.03-6.46) years among all patients, 8.36 (95\% CI, 8.0-8.8) years for Black patients, 8.56 (95\% CI, 7.3-9.7) years for Hispanic patients, 5.48 (95\% CI, 5.2-5.7) years for White patients, and 4.48 (95\% CI, 4.1-5.0) years for other patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions and Relevance{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The findings of this cohort study of patients with nmCRPC suggest that differences in outcomes by race and ethnicity exist; in addition, Black and Hispanic men may have considerably improved outcomes when treated in an equal-access setting.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
